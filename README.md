### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vincent De Caluwe, I work as a data analyst for [@Ambassify](https://www.ambassify.com/).
For the past 7 years I've been working as a data analyst on data warehousing, reporting, visualization and analytics.
I love to extract insights from data in order to facilitate data-driven decision making.
